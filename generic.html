									<h1>Thought catalog</h1>
								</header>
								<p>A lot of people say they want to travel, but only very few get to actually experience the wonders of the world. Travel has a different meaning to everyone – some do it to escape their everyday life, some do it to take the kids on vacation, some do it to find themselves, but not us. We live to travel – we want to make a life of travel.</h2>
								<p>We’ve never wanted a conventional life, a life that we feel a need to escape, filled with discontent and comfort. We’ve never wanted to be stuck in an office building all day, never able to wander away when it’s time to leave. We’ve always wanted more than that, and it’s possible.</p>

										<h3>Travel means freedom</h3>
										<p>
											Travel to us means waking up at 4 AM to get to the best spot to watch the sunrise. It means getting lost in a different country without Google maps and turning it into a whole new adventure. It means trying to communicate in broken English and being thankful that the other person is willing to try to understand you. It means learning patience and taking acceptance to a whole new level.
										</p>

										<h3>Travel > money</h3>
										<p>I want to trust that where I am is exactly where I’m supposed to be. I want to look past what’s right in front of me and learn to love the world harder for all it truly is.
											This is what travel means to us – to live fully, to accept others, to learn in every area you can and to allow the world to shape you in to the best person you can truly be.
